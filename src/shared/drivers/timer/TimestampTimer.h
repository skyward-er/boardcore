/**
 * @brief Utility for microsecond timestamp values.
 *
 * @deprecated
 * This namespace provided access to sub-millisecond timestamp values for
 * precise timing requirements before Miosix 2.7, since at that time Miosix only
 * had millisecond-accurate tick values. It has now been deprecated in favor of
 * `miosix::getTime()` which has nanosecond resolution. The class is kept
 * for compatibility reasons and should be removed in the future.
 *
 * The old timer used a 32bit value and the TIM2 or TIM5 hardware peripherals,
 * at a frequency of 250KHz. This way the timer had a resolution of 4us, it
 * would overflow after 4.7 hours and only required a 2-bit shift left
 * operation to convert from counter tick to microseconds.
