/**
 * @brief A task that executes a user-defined function at specific time points,
 * or when signaled.
 *
 * This class is designed to be used in situations where a task needs to be
 * executed within specific deadlines, irregularly. The task will wake up at the
 * specified time points and execute the user-defined function. The task can
 * also be signaled to wake up and run immediately, regardless of the time
 * points.
 *
 * This class essentially emulates an EDF (Earliest Deadline First) scheduler on
 * a single thread. If a high-enough priority value is used, the task will be
 * scheduled as soon as the deadline is reached, this can be useful for hard
 * real-time tasks.
 *
 * Users must implement the following functions:
 *
 * - calculateNextDeadline(): This function should return the next time point
 * when the task should wake up and run. Use TimePoint::max() to indicate
 * that there is no deadline, and the task should not run until signaled.
 *
 * - task(): This function is invoked when the task wakes up after a deadline
 * expiration. Users should implement the logic that needs to be executed at
 * that time.
