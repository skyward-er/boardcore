 * @brief The Task Scheduler allow to manage simple tasks with a single thread.
 * All the task added must not take more than 1ms to execute and should take
 * less time as possible to ensure other tasks are executed as they are supposed
 * to.
 *
 * HOW TO USE THE TASK SCHEDULER
 *
 * TaskScheduler.add(nonblocking_std::function_without_sleeps, millisec, id);
 * and.. it works like magic. :)
 *
 * Example:
 *    void magic_std::function() {
 *        // do something NONBLOCKING and WITHOUT SLEEPS
 *    }
 *    TaskScheduler.add(magic_std::function, 150);

     * - ONE_SHOT: Allows to run the task once. When it is executed, it is
     * removed from the tasks list.
     * - SKIP: If for whatever reason a task can't be executed when
     * it is supposed to (e.g. another thread occupies the CPU), the scheduler
     * doesn't recover the missed executions but instead skips those and
     * continues normally. This ensures that all the events are aligned with
     * the original start tick. In other words, the period and the start tick of
     * a task specifies the time slots the task has to be executed. If one of
     * this time slots can't be used, that specific execution won't be
     * recovered.
     * - RECOVER: On the other hand, the RECOVER policy ensures that the missed
     * executions are run. However, this will cause the period to not be
     * respected and the task will run consecutively for some time (See issue
     * #91).
