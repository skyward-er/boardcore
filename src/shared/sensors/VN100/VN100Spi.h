/**
 * Driver for the VN100 SPI IMU.
 *
 * The VN100 sensor is a calibrated IMU which includes accelerometer,
 * magnetometer, gyroscope, barometer and temperature sensor. It also provides
 * attitude data (yaw, pith, roll, quaternion).
 * This driver samples imu compensated data (accelerometer, gyroscope and
 * magnetometer) and quaternion data.
 *
 * The sampling rate is 400Hz. The data ready interrupt can be set to a lower
 * rate by changing the syncOutSkipFactor parameter.
 *
 * ATTENTION: at least 100 microseconds has to pass between the read/write
 * operations with the sensor.
