/**
 * @brief Driver for the VN100S IMU.
 *
 * The VN100S sensor is a calibrated IMU which includes accelerometer,
 * magnetometer, gyroscope, barometer and temperature sensor. Ã¹The device
 * provides also a calibration matrix and an anti-drift matrix for the gyroscope
 * values. The goal of this driver though is to interface the sensor in its
 * basic use. Things like asynchronous data and anti-drift techniques haven't
 * been implemented yet. The driver is intended to be used with the "Rugged
 * sensor" version (aka only UART communication) although the actual VN100S chip
 * is capable also of SPI communication.
 *
 * The VN100S supports both binary and ASCII encoding for communication but via
 * serial and with the asynchronous mode disabled only ASCII is available. The
 * protocol also provides two algorithms to verify the integrity of the messages
 * (8 bit checksum and 16 bit CRC-CCITT) both selectable by the user using the
 * constructor method. The serial communication also can be established with
 * various baud rates:
 * - 9600
 * - 19200
 * - 38400
 * - 57600
 * - 115200
 * - 128000
 * - 230400
 * - 460800
 * - 921600
