/**
 * @brief Driver for Ublox GPSs
 *
 * This driver handles communication and setup with Ublox GPSs. It uses the
 * binary UBX protocol to retrieve and parse navigation data quicker than using
 * the string based NMEA.
 *
 * At initialization it configures the device with the specified baudrate, reset
 * the configuration and sets up UBX messages and GNSS parameters.
 *
 * Communication with the device is performed through a file, the driver opens
 * the serial port under the filepath /dev/<serialPortName>.
 * There is no need for the file to be setted up beforhand.
 *
 * This driver was written for a NEO-M9N gps with the latest version of UBX.
