/**
 * @brief Driver for ADS1118 adc.
 *
 * The ADS1118 is a 16-bit delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter.
 * It measures the difference of two inputs configured by a MUX. The device
 * allows also to read each of the four pins in reference to GND. A temperature
 * sensor is also included.
 *
 * The communication uses the SPI protocol and the maximum allowed frequency is
 * 4MHz. Configuration is applied by writing a 16bit value to the device.
 * Sampled voltages or temperature readings are obtained also by reading a 16bit
 * value while writing the configuration.
 *
 * Data rate between 8Hz and 860Hz can be programmed and an internal
 * programmable gain amplifier can be set with a sensitivity range from ±0.256V
 * to ±6.144V (note that the inputs must remain between VCC or GND).
 *
 * The data rate should be choosen as low as possible to allow the delta-sigma
 * adc to average the input voltage (this allows a less noisy reading).
 *
 * The device can work in two modes:
 * - CONTINUOUS_CONV_MODE: Continuously read the last configured channel, when
 * you make a read you'll obtain the lates reading
 * - SINGLE_SHOT_MODE: A single conversion is performed when the configuration
 * is written
 *
 * The ADS1118 is a simple device, it has a single data register where it can
 * store the reading, therefore it can sample a single input at a time. sample()
 * cycles through the enabled channels one at a time and writes it's
 * configuration while reading the value of the previous written one.
 *
 * As an example if you need to read 4 inputs at 50Hz you should set all the
 * data rates at 250Hz (50Hz x * 4 = 200Hz) and call sample() at a rate of
 * 200Hz.
 *
 * An example for how to use the driver can be found in the test code
 * (src/tests/drivers/test-ads1118.cpp)
