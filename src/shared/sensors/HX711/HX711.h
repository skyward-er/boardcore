/**
 * @brief Load cell transducer.
 *
 * HX711 is a precision 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) designed for
 * weigh scales and industrial control applications to interface directly with a
 * bridge sensor.
 *
 * The input multiplexer selects either Channel A or B differential input to the
 * low-noise programmable gain amplifier (PGA). Channel A can be programmed with
 * a gain of 128 or 64, corresponding to a full-scale differential input voltage
 * of ±20mV or ±40mV respectively, when a 5V supply is connected to AVDD analog
 * power supply pin. Channel B has a fixed gain of 32. On-chip power supply
 * regulator eliminates the need for an external supply regulator to provide
 * analog power for the ADC and the sensor. Clock input is flexible. It can be
 * from an external clock source, a crystal, or the on-chip oscillator that does
 * not require any external component. On-chip power-on-reset circuitry
 * simplifies digital interface initialization. There is no programming needed
 * for the internal registers. All controls to the HX711 are through the pins.
