/**
 * @brief MAX31855 thermocouple sensor driver.
 *
 * The MAX31855 performs cold-junction compensation and digitizes the signal
 * from a K, J, N, T, S, R, or E type thermocouple depending on the selected
 * product variant. The data is output in  a signed 14-bit, SPI-compatible,
 * read-only format. This converter resolves temperatures to 0.25°C, allows
 * readings as high as +1800°C and as low as -270°C, and exhibits thermocouple
 * accuracy of ±2°C for temperatures ranging from -200°C to +700°C for K-type
 * thermocouples.
