/**
 * @brief Driver for ADS131M08 8 simultaneous channels adc.
 *
 * The ADS131M08 is an eight-channel, simultaneously-sampling, 24-bit,
 * delta-sigma (ΔΣ), analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The individual ADC
 * channels can be independently configured depending on the sensor input. A
 * low-noise, programmable gain amplifier (PGA) provides gains ranging from 1
 * to 128 to amplify low-level signals.
 *
 * Each channel on the ADS131M08 contains a digital decimation filter that
 * demodulates the output of the ΔΣ modulators. Offset and gain calibration
 * registers can be programmed to automatically adjust output samples for
 * measured offset and gain errors.
 *
 * The device features a "global-chop mode" to reduce offset error and offset
 * drift inherent to the device due to mismatch in the internal circuitry to
 * very low levels. When global-chop mode is enabled by setting the GC_EN bit in
 * the GLOBAL_CHOP_CFG register, the device uses the conversion results from two
 * consecutive internal conversions taken with opposite input polarity to cancel
 * the device offset voltage.
 *
 * Each channel has a dedicated input multiplexer that controls which signals
 * are routed to the ADC channels:
 * - The analog input pins corresponding to the given channel
 * - AGND, which is helpfu for offset calibraton
 * - Positive DC test signal
 * - Negative DC test signal
 *
 * Each channel also feature an integrated programmable gain amplifier (PGA)
 * that provides gains of 1 to 128. Each channel has an independent PGA.
 *
 * The device communicates via SPI, the maximum allowed frequency is 25MHz.
 *
 * The ADC can work on 3 different power configurations depending on the clock
 * frequency:
 * - High-resulution: 250-32KSPS
 * - Low-power: 125-16KSPS
 * - Very-low-power: 62.5-8KSPS
 * You will probably have the ADC in high resolution mode.
