 * @brief Google's bfloat16 type.
 *
 * This type is used to represent floating-point numbers with reduced
 * precision, but with the same exponent range as float.
 *
 * It's a 16-bit representation where the first 8 bits are the exponent and the
 * last 7 bits are the mantissa, with the least significant bits being dropped.
 *
 * Casting to and from float is fast since it only involves shifting bits.
